Second task, Add current Eth price on profile page
Added the eth token address for bsc net.

Third task, wallet connect on profile page
https://docs.walletconnect.com/web3modal/react/about?platform=wagmi

Not able to complete, wallet connect library cannot be installed on nodejs 16, moving to nodejs 18 also fails due to libraries conflict.

I can complete this but will it will require an overhaul of the whole front end and updating libraries to their latest version as well, which will take a while (2-5 days).

There are many outdated and deprecated libraries installed in the front end side, also using react-scripts which is deprecated for a while now, which has the old babel compiler, due to this many new block chain libraries are also not supported.
Using old libraries also decreases the security risk as many old libraries uses old source code, which is exploited in blockchain environment.
